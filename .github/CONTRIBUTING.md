# Metrix Contribution Guide

Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing to Metrix :).

To ensure everyone has a nice experience working in the project, we wrote this document to guide you in what you should do
to write your first PR to Metrix.

First of all, please make sure to walk through the following:

- [The Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [How to open an Issue](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
- [How to open a Pull Request](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

Then you may check:

- [How to start contributing](#how-to-start-contributing)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [Setup the development environment](#
- [Contribution Workflow](#contribution-workflow)
- [Suggesting a new feature](#suggesting-a-new-feature)

## How to start contributing

A good way to start contributing with Metrix is to take a look at the [Open Issues](https://github.com/felipevfa/metrix-tec2/issues).
Issues tagged with "good 1st issue" are normally easy enough to fix and are good targets for your first contribution.

You can also scan our documentation for typos, or maybe for something that should be made more clear. That's also good way to
start and open your first pull request.

Finally, remember that opening issues is also a way to contribuet. If you find a bug, please open a new issue so we can take a
look at it!
